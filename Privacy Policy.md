- The PDFs you upload are transfered from your downloads and the app folder within your own device for the app's access. The photos you use as book covers will also be transferred in a similar fashion. Nothing else is accessed.
- You give the permission to your data and upload all files yourself. The app doesn't automatically do anything.
